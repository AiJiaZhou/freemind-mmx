<a name="faqI_0"><h2>Installation</h2></a> 
<a name="faqI_1"><h3>How can I install Freemind?</h3></a>
<!-- As of version 0.7 there is an installer for Windows.  -->
FreeMind requires Java 1.4 or higher

If Java is not installed, please abort the installation and download the JRE - Java Runtime Environment from
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html">here.</a>

<a name="faqI_1"><h3>I installed Java JRE and FreeMind, execute freemind.exe (or the icon with the butterfly) and nothing happens. Why?</h3></a>
Your Java installation is buggy. Try to excecute using "Run command..." in the start menu the command
"javaw.exe". If this fails, you have to arrange your path settings, such that the java/bin directory is in your path.<p>
Or try to start the batch "freemind.bat", read the messages and react.

<a name="faqU_0"><h2>Usage</h2></a> 
<a name="faqI_1"><h3>How can I create a graphical link?</h3></a>
This is done by Drag&amp;Drop using the mouse, click on a node, hold the Shift and the Control keys and don't release them now,
move this node to the destination node, release the mouse button (and now you may also release the keys, but not earlier), 
and there is your link.

<a name="faqC_0"><h2>Customization</h2></a> 
<a name="faqC_1"><h3>Using another browser</h3></a> 

If you want to use another browser, edit the <a href="#faqC_2">user.properties</a> file and
change the following property according to your operation system:
<ul>
<li>default_browser_command_windows_nt</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_windows_9x</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_mac</li> 
<li>default_browser_command_other_os</li> 
</ul>
You have to write something like 
<ul><li>default_browser_command_windows_nt = C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe "{0}"</li></ul>


<a name="faqC_2"><h3>Editing the user properties</h3></a> 

The <b>user.properties</b> file resides in a subdirectory called "freemind" of your home directory. 
As an example, under Windows 2000, the file is normally in:
<ul>
<li>C:\Documents and Settings\&lt;username&gt;\freemind</li> 
</ul>

<a name="faqP_0"><h2>Common Problems</h2></a> 
<a name="faqD_1"><h3>Cannot open the Documentation in the Help menu</h3></a> 
The path doc/maps/freemind.mm is not found. This is due to your own user.properties file which contains the wrong path
from the last version 0.6.7 of freemind. Yust delete the entry <b>docmapurl = ./doc/freemind.mm</b> from the user.properties.

<a name="faqD_1"><h3>If there are more than one link in the same area, I cannot change the properties of the link</h3></a> 
The reason is that right clicking these links, the first link is taken that intersects a rectangle around the cursor. 
To get the other link(s), you have to find a place without other interfering links or you have to fold other links, such that they do not disturb. 

<a name="faqD_0"><h2>Development</h2></a> 
<a name="faqD_1"><h3>Where can I find the latest beta version of FreeMind?</h3></a> 
Look at <a href="http://freemind.sourceforge.net/testversions/">http://freemind.sourceforge.net/testversions/</a>.
<a name="faqD_1"><h3>How to compile Freemind on my own?</h3></a> 

This is a longer story as you need some prerequisites. Thanks to Bob Alexander, we have a 
<a href="docs/compile/windows/Quick%20guide%20to%20compiling%20Freemind%20on%20an%20XP%20system.html">website</a> explaining the issue.

<a name="faqD_2"><h3>How to get the sources from Sourceforge?</h3></a> 

See <a href="#faqD_1">How to compile Freemind on my own?</a>.

<a name="faqD_3"><h3>How to use CVS with Eclipse?</h3></a> 

Thanks to Bob Alexander, we have a <a href="docs/Using CVS via Eclipse/index.html">website</a> explaining the issue.
But remember that it is difficult to change directory and file names under CVS. Moreover, it not easy to remove files completely.
So, take care checking files in. The project manager thanks a lot.
