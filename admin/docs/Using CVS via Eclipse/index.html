<h1>Using CVS from within Eclipse</h1>

<p>Please read the <a href="disclaimer.htm">disclaimer</a> before using this document. </p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This tutorial want to show some basic usage of CVS from within the Eclipse development environment.
  The scenario we will be using is the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>We will <a href="Creating local copy.htm">build a local copy</a> of a branch of the Freemind project CVS tree from Sourceforge repository.</li>
<li>We will <a href="dreamweaver editing.htm">make some modifications</a> on our local machine</li>
<li>We will commit our local changes onto Freemind's CVS repository</li>
</ol>
<p>For this example we will use a branch of the project which contains documentation, so that if I manage to break something while writing this tutorial I will not be chased by the police 8->
</p>
<p>We will also need to assume that you have registered on Sourceforge and that the project managers have granted you with the permission to write on the CVS tree. The read/write connection with <em>uploading</em> to the CVS server is done via the <em>extssh</em> protocol</p>
<p>Please note that the CVS repository can also be accessed anonymously (with a protocol called <em>pserver</em>) without requiring registration but only to <em>download</em> files.</p>
<p>We will use the <em>update</em> verb to indicate downloading files from CVS to your local machine and <em>commit</em> to indicate upload.
</p>
<p>As the example we are going to use is about documentation kept in an HTML tree, I will also make some examples on how we will create or update this material from within the Macromedia <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/dreamweaver/">Dreamweaver MX 2004</a> trial package. Of course you are free to use any other web authoring package you like. Unfortunately Dreamweaver AFAIK does not support direct CVS interfacing and therefore in this guide's context is used only to locally edit my HTML files. </p>
