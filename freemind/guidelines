This file collects guidelines and aims of the FreeMind project to avoid possible conflicts.

Coding style
-Each class is imported on its own, no "import javax.swing.*" imports.

General
-FreeMind is a generic editor for tree-structured data and doesn't prefer any special kind of data.
-All code specific to any special kind of data is contained in a special Mode for that data.

View
-The data is represented as a Mind Map, as described by Tony Buzan.
-A modular design for the view may be implemented to make other views possible (JTree-like, top-down hierarchy etc.)

Controller
-Every command should be available both with the keyboard and the mouse.

***ToDo***
-Drag'n'drop style cutting and pasting. (by moving a square around)
-Named edges (edges with text).
