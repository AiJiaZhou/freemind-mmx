<h1>Introduction</h1>

Welcome to FreeMind and the world of computer-based Mindmapping ;-) <BR>
To avoid confusion, yes, FreeMind indeed <B>is</B> a Mindmapping tool, but FreeMind is also more. It can represent any tree-structured data as a MindMap, and I look forward to once using it as a generic interface to the computer.<BR>
However, this is a dream, but currently you can use FreeMind as a Mindmapping tool, which is what all FreeMind users do. FreeMind has <B>Modes</B>, which means that you can use a specific mode to do a specific task, for instance MindMap-Mode for creating and viewing Mindmaps. The MindMap-Mode will be the only that you will use now, but keep in mind that there are other modes to come.<BR>
To use FreeMind efficiently, it's best to learn the keyboard shortcuts, so you don't have to take your hands away from keyboard, what would interrupt your workflow.<BR><BR>
After all, I hope you like FreeMind, as I do, and have fun with it!
