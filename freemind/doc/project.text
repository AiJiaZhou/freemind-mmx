<h4>STATUS</h4>
First of all, this is ALPHA Software! That means, it is not stable. There are many bugs for you to find, so if you find one, send me a mail so that I can fix it. You want to have stable software, don't you? So _really_ do this, or you may find the bug in the next release, too. (And if you find a bug, it IS a bug, not a feature, as Micro$oft tries to tell you ;-).

<h4>LICENSE</h4>
<b>This program is licensed under the GPL.</b>

<h4>FEEDBACK</h4>
If you like the program, have some ideas for new features, find any bugs, send a mail to: <a href=mailto:joergmueller@bigfoot.com>joergmueller@bigfoot.com</a>

<h4>MISSING FEATURES</h4>
This is an early version, so there are many features missing: There is no undo/redo functionality (so be careful what you do ;-), there is no autosaving. All this will be fixed in future releases.

<h4>BUGS</h4>
The fontselection is buggy, but thats a bug of Java (the swing library), so the only thing I can do is wait...

<h4>TODO</h4>
Of course performance must be improved, and more modes must be implemented. Modes that will come are a serious filesystem browser, a XML/HTML editor, a client to a mindmapping-server (so that multiple users can edit the same mindmap), and everything you can imagine that deals with tree-structures. In future I want to create an applet so you can view mindmaps in your browser (combined with hyperlinking, this can lead us to a totally different web). In future a modular view architecture can be implemented, maybe with true graph presentation. If you can think of anything else one could do with freemind, tell me.
