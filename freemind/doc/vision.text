<H2>Vision</H2>
FreeMind now has evolved from a specific Mind Map Editor to a generic editor for tree structured data. I want FreeMind to become for tree structured data what emacs is for linear data (ie. text). The front end is a tree presented as a Mind Map, other views may be implemented in future. The backend can deal either with a tree or with a graph, but the important thing is that both are presented as a tree to the user. This way FreeMind will provide easy, intuitive access to many kinds of complex data and become even more useful with every new backend/mode that is implemented.<BR> 
What I had in mind when I began to write FreeMind, was creating a collaborative mind where people can intuitively share there ideas, knowledge and thoughts with each other. Of course FreeMind is only a first step into this direction, but I did this first step. Now a Mode must be implemented that makes collaboration over the Internet possible, maybe using the Topic-Map standard. I think linear text is a very poor way of representing knowledge, and by using trees and networks, visual representation, internet collaboration and open source we should be able to create some kind of a collaborative mind.
