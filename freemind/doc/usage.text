<h1>Usage</h1>

<h4>Configuration</h4>
FreeMind is widely configureable. You can select the language, english, german or french, make various defaults and choose which keybindings to use.<BR>
To configure FreeMind, edit either the file freemindUser.properties, which you should normally use, or freemind.properties, where I made the defaults, in any text editor, make your changes and store the file again as plain text. If you start FreeMind, the new properties are read in.<BR>
Configurations made in freemindUser.properties overwrite those made in freemind.properties, so you can play around and just delete the changed values from freemindUser.properties, if your changes don't work.

<h4>Usage</h4>
FreeMind should be intuitively to use. Just add the nodes you want. If you have problems with anything and think it's not intuitively, just send me a mail so that I can change it in the next release.

<h4>Development</h4>
Because FreeMind is still in development phase, there are some unimplemented or experimental features:
<UL>
<LI>Printing: Printing is still experimental and doesn't work well.</LI>
<LI>Fonts: Due to a bug in the swing library, the selection of font attributes is somewhat buggy.</LI>
<LI>File-Mode: Is still experimental, only basics are implemented.</LI>
</UL>
Of course there are still some bugs in FreeMind (any software has bugs), but I use FreeMind every day and found it quite usable and stable. If you have any problems, feel free to send me a mail.
