Changes made in Freemind 0.7.1:
===============================
* Bug fix: automatic save occurs not so often (in fact, only if something has changed since the last automatic save), and uses a better filename.
* Daniel changed the documentation.
* Bug fix: Documentation opened twice.
* Security fix: path for auto save is changeable and points to the freemind user properties directory by default
* At normal shutdown, the auto saves are deleted, but this is configurable.
* Bug fix: When a map is closed, the saving stops (Thanks to Karim).
* Bug fix: Blocking is enabled for graphical link popup menu.
* Ant task (development only): ant run is working.

RC3:
----
* Bug fix: select sons of root with shift now gives only sons on the correct side.
* Removed the delayed selection from the menu, it is deprecated now, and will be removed completely at the next release.
* Corrected shading of the rood node for drag&drop
* Bug fix: Selection mechanism: if drag&drop is started, the node under the cursor is selected. Branches are now selected using AltGr or Alt (depends on OS).
* Mac change: the browser call is changed according to Nick. Thanks.
* Bug fix: If more than one selection, folding and editing with mouse disabled. The old behaviour was not useful as the last selected was opened in the editor or was folded even if one pressed on another node.
* Little feature: folding of many selected nodes is working.
* Bug fix: Continuous selection with Shift key corrected. Now, more than one of these selection ranges can be used.
* Logger is now available at the FreeMind interface.
* Automatic save introduced (necessary feature until undo is available)

RC2:
----
* Bug fix: the context menu for graphical links appears not only in the neighbourhood of the link line, but appears in the *FILLED* arc, that is surrounded by the arc. Fixed.
* Selection method added: selection via mouse click as in office programs.
* Click method: 
  - inner node
    + single click: fold
    + double click: fold
  - leaf (node without childs)
    + single click: edit
    + double click: edit
* POSITION is only saved if the node is son of root. This prevents having lots of POSITION tags in the saved XML.
* POSITION is chosen right if dropped onto root. (left half, pasted to left, right half, pasted to - you guess it? - right!)
* Left and Right is respected with ENTER.
* Bug fix: cutting nodes including any of their children or grant-children works now. This removes the bug with a moved tree that is completely marked.

RC1:
----
* Bug fix: nodes with arc and bubble nodes have antialiased text when the antialiasing  of edges is on
* Removed the arc, that distinguished bubble nodes from folded nodes. More discussion is needed.
* Selection method changed: double click is now only for editing if the node is *not* an inner node.
* Documentation enhanced: Creation of graphical links is better described
* Bug fix: Zoom in/out uses step one again.
* Bug fix: System default look and feel is set if so stated in the freemind.properties or user.properties.
