Changes made in Freemind 0.7.1:
===============================
RC2:
----
* Bug fix: the context menu for graphical links appears not only in the neighbourhood of the link line, but appears in the *FILLED* arc, that is surrounded by the arc. Fixed.
* Selection method added: selection via mouse click as in office programs.
* Click method: 
  - inner node
    + single click: fold
    + double click: fold
  - leaf (node without childs)
    + single click: edit
    + double click: edit
* POSITION is only saved if the node is son of root. This prevents having lots of POSITION tags in the saved XML.
* POSITION is chosen right if dropped onto root. (left half, pasted to left, right half, pasted to - you guess it? - right!)
* Left and Right is respected with ENTER.
* Bug fix: cutting nodes including any of their children or grant-children works now. This removes the bug with a moved tree that is completely marked.

RC1:
----
* Bug fix: nodes with arc and bubble nodes have antialiased text when the antialiasing  of edges is on
* Removed the arc, that distinguished bubble nodes from folded nodes. More discussion is needed.
* Selection method changed: double click is now only for editing if the node is *not* an inner node.
* Documentation enhanced: Creation of graphical links is better described
* Bug fix: Zoom in/out uses step one again.
* Bug fix: System default look and feel is set if so stated in the freemind.properties or user.properties.
